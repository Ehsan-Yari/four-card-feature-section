### What I learned

The most challenging part of this project was implementing the card layout for the desktop version. To tackle this challenge, I decided to utilize the CSS Grid layout. Firstly, I changed the flow direction of the Grid by using the `grid-auto-flow: column` property. This adjustment arranged the grid items in a column-wise order. Additionally, I applied `grid-row: span 2 / span 2` to both the first and last child elements of the grid, which caused them to span across two rows, providing the desired layout. These modifications successfully resolved the challenges I encountered with the card layout in the desktop version.
